# WooCommerce store regular product price in item line of order

Stores the regular price in item line of order.

As WooCommerce doesn't seem to do this and I need it for generating invoices for customers, this script allows me to save the regular price of purchased products even if they were purchased on sale.

## Usage/Examples

Just insert these two functions in the functions.php file of your theme.
